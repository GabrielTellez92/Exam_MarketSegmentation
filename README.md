# Exam_MarketSegmentation

Exam 1 for Practicum I (part of the University of Texas at San Antonio Master's in Data Analytics program). After taking the position of a particular company, the objective of the exam was to develop a market segmentation system using the Simmons National Consumer Study and apply the market segmentation to a specific business issue. 

I decided to focus on Banana Republic and the possibility of expanding the brand's consumer base to the NCAA audience. Banana Republic has reported negative sales for the past five years while its sister brands (Gap and Old Navy) are staying competitive. In order to stay competitive, my idea behind this market segmentation analysis was to find out how viable it would be for Banana Republic to expand its apparel to sports audiences. 

Further details about my thought process are included in the Word document Exam1_MarketSegmentation. All analysis was done in SAS so to make it easier to open, I included the Word document Exam1_Code with all the SAS code.
